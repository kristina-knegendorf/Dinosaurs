        <h2>What are dinosaurs?</h2>
        <p>
          Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that dominated the land for over 140
          million years (more than 160 million years in some parts of the
          world). They evolved diverse shapes and sizes, from the fearsome giant
          <a class="spino" href="./Cretaceous.html#spino"
            ><span>Spinosaurus</span></a
          >
          to the chicken-sized Microraptor, and were able to survive in a
          variety of ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the reasons for dinosaurs' success is that they had straight
          back legs, perpendicular to their bodies. This allowed them to use
          less energy to move than other reptiles that had a sprawling stance
          like today's lizards and crocodiles. With their legs positioned under
          their bodies rather than sticking out to the side, dinosaurs' weight
          was also better supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many dinosaur species became extinct around 66 million years ago, but
          a group of living dinosaurs are still with us today: birds.

        <h2>Other prehistoric reptiles</h2>
        <p>
          Dinosaurs are archosaurs, a larger group of reptiles that first
          appeared about 251 million years ago, near the start of the
          <a class="triassic" href="./triassic.html"
            ><span>Triassic Period</span></a
          >. Some other non-dinosaur reptiles are also archosaurs, including
          pterosaurs (the now-extinct flying reptiles) and modern crocodiles and
          their ancestors. These and many other types of ancient reptiles are
          often wrongly called dinosaurs. Marine reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs,
          plesiosaurs and mosasaurs are not dinosaurs. Nor is Dimetrodon (left)
          or other reptiles in the same group (previously called 'mammal-like
          reptiles' and now called synapsids). None of these other extinct
          groups shared the characteristic upright stance of dinosaurs.

        <h2>What killed the dinosaurs?</h2>
        <p>
          The fossil record shows that for the first 175 million years of their
          existence, dinosaurs took on a huge variety of forms as the
          environment changed and new species evolved that were suited to these
          new conditions. Dinosaurs that failed to adapt went extinct. But then
          66 million years ago, over a relatively short time, dinosaurs
          disappeared completely (except for birds). Many other animals also
          died out, including pterosaurs, large marine reptiles, and ammonites.
          Although the number of dinosaur species was already declining, this
          suggests a sudden catastrophic event sealed their fate - something
          that caused unfavourable changes to the environment to occur more
          quickly than dinosaurs and other creatures could adapt.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exact nature of this catastrophic event is still open to
          scientific debate. Evidence suggests an asteroid impact was the main
          culprit. Volcanic eruptions that caused large-scale climate change may
          also have been involved, together with more gradual changes to Earth's
          climate that happened over millions of years. Whatever the causes, the
          huge extinction that ended the age of the dinosaur left gaps in
          ecosystems around the world. These were subsequently filled by the
          only dinosaurs to survive - birds - and mammals, both of which went on
          to evolve rapidly.
