        <h2>The Cretaceous climate and continents</h2>
        <p>
          By the end of the Cretaceous period the continents had moved almost
          into the positions they are in today. Back then Earth was a lot warmer
          than it is today and there was little or no ice at the North Pole or
          South Pole. Sea levels fluctuated but were in the most part high. In
          fact, at times sea levels were 170 metres higher than today. Shallow
          seas formed, dividing some continents. In the Late Cretaceous, for
          example, the Western Interior Seaway split North America into two
          landmasses. At its largest this sea was more than 3,000 kilometres
          long, almost 1,000 kilometres wide and 760 metres deep.

        </div>
        <p>
          The plant life of the Cretaceous was quite different to that of today.
          For example, temperate rainforest grew close to the poles, which back
          then were ice free. Unlike the temperate rainforests that exist today
          in North America's Pacific Northwest, including in Oregon and
          Washington, each winter the Cretaceous polar forests would have had to
          survive four months of the year living in the total darkness of polar
          night. A very long period without Sun for plants to survive!

        <h2>Dinosaurs of the Cretaceous</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to Cretaceous dinosaurs, we often think of Triceratops
          and T. rex, though these dinosaurs only lived at the end of the
          period, around 68-66 million years ago. In the Early Cretaceous,
          iguanodontians were some of the first dinosaurs to evolve complex
          chewing mechanisms rather than just gulping down food like other
          reptiles. In the Late Cretaceous, hadrosaurs - the duck-billed
          dinosaurs - did similar, using their hundreds of tiny teeth to grind
          up vast amounts of plant matter. Susie calls them 'the cows of the
          Cretaceous'.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the northern hemisphere's biggest dinosaurs lived during the
          <a class="jurassic" href="./Jurassic.html"><span>Jurassic</span></a
          >, it was in the Cretaceous that the southern hemisphere saw its
          largest reptiles. In fact, during this period, some of the biggest
          land animals to have ever existed appeared. The largest of all belong
          to a group of sauropod dinosaurs called titanosaurs. Patagotitan
          (left), a 37.5-metre-long titanosaur from Argentina in South America,
          might be the largest found so far. But it's possible that one day
          we'll find even bigger dinosaurs.

            Quetzalcoatlus northropi is the one of the largest known animals to

          </p>
          <p>
            Studies have shown that Quetzalcoatlus could take off under its own
            power, but once aloft it may have spent much of its time soaring. To
            test the flight on Quetzalcoatlus, a program sponsored by Johnson
            Wax involved the construction of a model flying machine. It was
            about half scale, the size of Quetzalcoatlus sp., and had a simple
            computer functioning as an autopilot. The experiment worked and the
            model flew through the skies with a combination of soaring and wing
            flapping. The model is now resting in the Smithsonian Institution
            Air and Space Museum.

          <h4>Spinosaurus</h4>
          <ul class="list-card">
            <li>Diet: carnivorus</li>
            <li>Size: 6-8 meters high, 14 meters long</li>
            <li>Weight: over 7400 kg</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Spinosaurus lived between 99 and 93.5 million years ago in the Late
            Cretaceous Period. At that time, its North African habitat consisted
            of tidal flats (muddy or marshy areas that get covered by the sea)
            and mangrove forests. The hottest time of year would bring long
            droughts, which would cause many lakes and rivers to dry up. This
            may have forced Spinosaurus to sometimes act as a land predator.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 14 metres long from nose to tail, Spinosaurus was longer than any
            other carnivorous dinosaur known to science. But we don't have any
            complete skeletons, so the full length is just an estimate. However,
            Spinosaurus' short hind legs meant that T. rex stood taller at the
            hips.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several theories about the impressive 1.5-metre-high sail
            on Spinosaurus' back. It may have helped to regulate the animal's
            body temperature or been part of an elaborate mating display. The
            sail may even have helped to propel the dinosaur through water. Some
            scientists have speculated that Spinosaurus had a thick, fleshy hump
            rather than a thin sail. But the latest research suggests that a
            thin sail is most likely.
