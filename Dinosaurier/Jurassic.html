              At the end of the

              there was a mass extinction, the causes of which are still hotly
              debated. Many large land animals were wiped out but the dinosaurs
              survived, giving them the opportunity to evolve into a wide
              variety of forms and increase in number.
            </p>
            <p>
              The single land mass, Pangaea, split into two, creating Laurasia
              in the north and Gondwana in the south. Despite this separation,
              similarities in their fossil records show that there were some
              land connections between the two continents early in the Jurassic.
              These regions became more distinct later in the period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Temperatures fell slightly, although it was still warmer than
              today due to higher amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
              Rainfall increased as a result of the large seas appearing between
              the land masses.
            </p>
            <p>
              These changes allowed plants such as ferns and horsetails to grow
              over huge areas. Some of this vegetation became the fossil fuels
              that we mine today. Elsewhere there were forests of tall conifer
              trees such as sequoias and monkey puzzles.

        <h2>Huge Dinosaurs</h2>
        <p>
          On land, dinosaurs were making their mark in a big way—literally. The
          plant-eating sauropod Brachiosaurus (on the left) stood up to 16
          meters tall, stretched 26 meters long, and weighed more than 80 tons.
          Diplodocus (on the right), another sauropod, was 27 meters long. These
          dinosaurs' sheer size may have deterred attack from
          <a class="allo" href="#allo"><span>Allosaurus</span></a
          >, a bulky, meat-eating dinosaur that walked on two powerful legs. But
          Allosaurus and other fleet-footed carnivores, such as the
          coelurosaurs, must have had occasional success. Other prey included
          the heavily armored stegosaurs.

          <h4>Stegosaurus</h4>

            <li>Diet: herbivorous</li>
            <li>Size: 4m high 9m long</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            Stegosaurus is famous for its two rows of kite-shaped plates that
            stick out from its neck, back, and tail
          </p>
          <p>
            Experts think that Stegosaurus’s tail was its main method of
            defense. The dino could swing its large tail from side to side with
            great force. A fossilized tailbone of Allosaurus has a hole in it
            the size of a Stegosaurus tail spike
          </p>
          <p>
            But this enormous animal had a brain that was only slightly larger
            than a walnut.

            <li>Diet: carnivorus</li>
            <li>Size: 3-5 meters high, 8-13 meters long</li>
            <li>Weight: over 2600 kg</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Experts aren’t sure if Allosaurus always hunted live prey—including
            giant plant-eaters like Apatosaurus—or if it sometimes scavenged
            dead or dying animals. Either way, Allosaurus was built to eat meat.
            Recent research on dino skulls found that Allosaurus could open its
            jaw so wide that it might’ve sometimes slashed its toothy upper jaw
            at prey, like a sharp knife. Then once it was time to grab a bite,
            Allosaurus likely ripped off pieces of meat by yanking its head
            backward, similar to how falcons and other raptors dine.
            Paleontologists have even found an Allosaurus bite mark on the neck
            plate of a Stegosaurus.
