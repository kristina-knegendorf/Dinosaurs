        <h2>The supercontinent Pangea</h2>
        <p>
          The Triassic is largely defined by extinctions, but it is also
          characterised by the position of the continents at that time. There
          was only one giant landmass: Pangea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pangea was an extraordinary thing and we haven't seen the like of it
          since.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is during the early part of the Triassic that the conifers took
          off. With flowering plants and grasses yet to evolve, conifers formed
          vast forests with individual trees reaching up to 30 metres tall. The
          understory would have been full of other conifer growth forms that no
          longer exist today, such as shrubs and woody vines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the environment became drier, the forests gave way to vast fern
          prairies. As animal life began to recover, what emerged on land was
          not so different from what came before. The most common vertebrate on
          the land was the small, herbivorous synapsid, or mammal-like reptile,
          called <a class="lystro" href="#lystro"><span>Lystrosaurus</span></a
          >.

        <h2>A shift in dominance</h2>
        <p>
          During the early Triassic the world was still dominated by mammal-like
          reptiles, but there was an increasingly important archosaurian
          component.By the end of the Middle Triassic, the synapsids were in
          decline and a diverse range of archosaurs had appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          The archosaurs were a component of the diapsid lineage, which includes
          many successful Mesozoic groups such as the dinosaurs and birds,
          pterosaurs, crocodilians and turtles.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the Late Triassic there was a shift in dominance between the
          mammal-like reptiles and the archosaurs. There are various theories as
          to what may have caused this, such as competition in a climate that
          was becoming steadily warmer and dryer or evolutionary stagnation. It
          seems that archosaurs were better able to fill the empty niches left
          following the extinction of some of the synapsid linages.

            It was a dog-sized animal whose peculiar lineage evolved about 270
            million years ago, and looked like a cross between a pig and a
            lizard. Snub-faced and splay-legged, it was a burrower with powerful
            front legs who probably dug its own den every night. And somehow, it
            managed to survive the worst mass extinction the world has ever
            known.

          <h4>Plateosaurus</h4>
          <ul class="list-card">
            <li>Diet: herbivorous</li>

            Plateosaurus was among the earliest dinosaurs to attain a relatively
            large size, growing to about 8 metres long. It was more massive than
            earlier dinosaurs and had bones that were stocky and thick. Although
            Plateosaurus could rise up on its two very strong hind legs, its
            forelimbs also were relatively well developed and strong, and it may
            have walked on two or four legs for various purposes. The small
            skull was perched atop a long, flexible neck and contained flat
            teeth serrated on the front and back edges.Plateosaurs were the
            first known large herbivores among the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs related
            to Plateosaurus have been found in South Africa, North America, and
            China.
